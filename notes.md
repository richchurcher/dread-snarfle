# Hackfest notes

 - many 'blockchain games' are thinly-disguised coin offerings ref: Extra Credits
 - as an exploration of the technology, what happens when you incorporate the technology as an intrinsic part of the game without worrying about selling in-game items?
 - as Josh points out, falling in love with your idea distances you from your users
 - guaranteeing uniqueness turns out to be really interesting in and of itself
 - players have a strong association with "points of difference" in games, being unique is a draw
 - you can still sell stuff
 - Josh mentions items could be traded in and out of compatible Plug games
 - creatures could wander in and out of compatible Plug games
 - tech: Plug a relatively easy entry point
 - idea of a creature as a 'user', albeit managed by the game
   - permission to slay
   - encounter transform
 - however: pain point associating 'users' with other models in the system
   - possible misunderstanding of the problem in Plug terms
   - manipulating string properties to track references to other models, error-prone
